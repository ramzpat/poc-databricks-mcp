This module contains data models used by the database client.
Currently, models are defined inline in the client as dictionaries.
This file serves as a placeholder for future Pydantic model definitions.

# Placeholder for future Pydantic models.
# Future models defined here should represent database entities using Pydantic
# to provide validation and serialization for fields such as catalog, schema,
# table name, and object type.
